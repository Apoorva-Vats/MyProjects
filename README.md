# Sales Overview Dashboard
A retail company is expanding rapidly across multiple regions. Their sales and operations teams are constantly working to boost revenue, but they’re struggling to answer some key questions.

Which regions and states are performing well?
Where should they invest more resources?

Are their strategies improving year-over-year, or are there areas of decline?
How do seasonal or monthly trends impact their sales performance?
Without clear answers to these questions, the business risks missing opportunities or investing in areas that don’t yield the best returns. The data they have is scattered, raw, and lacks a unified way to draw insights. They need a solution that’s not just numbers on a page but a comprehensive view that empowers decision-making.
This is where the challenge begins—creating a dynamic solution that can answer these questions for every region, every state, and every year, while being simple and intuitive for stakeholders to use.
